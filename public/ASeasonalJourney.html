<h1>A Seasonal Journey</h1>
<h2>SPRING</h2>
<p>Spring arrives with a burst of lifeâ€”trees bloom with fresh green leaves, flowers blossom in vibrant colors, and the air is filled with birdsong and gentle breezes.</p>
<h2>SUMMER</h2>
<p>Summer follows with warmth and brightness, where the sun shines long and strong, rivers flow with energy, and fields ripen under golden skies</p>
<h2>AUTUMN</h2>
<p>Autumn, or fall, paints the world in shades of amber, red, and brown; leaves gently drift to the ground, and nature prepares for rest.</p>
<h2>WINTER</h2>
<p>Winter blankets the land in calm and silence, with snow-covered trees and a peaceful chill in the air</p>
